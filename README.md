## How to Run?

### With Docker

If you have docker installed and running, you can run this app straightforwardly with thees commands:

```bash
$ cd <this-app-folder>
$ docker-compose up --build
```

### Without Docker

In case you do not have docker or want to run in on a bare server/machine, you need to run client and API in 2 separate terminals. First, open a terminal to run the backend side API:

```bash
$ cd api
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
This should get the server API up and running and accessible at http://localhost:8080/ in postman. You can get and import postman collection [here](docs/api-postman-collection.json) to play with API endpoints.

Next, you need to open another terminal for client-side and hit these commands there:
```bash
$ cd client
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
This should get the client-side up and running and accessible at http://localhost:3000/ in the browser. You can have a look at the demo video [here](docs/frontend-demo.mp4) to get a better understanding.
